## Installation

Clone the repository. Run `npm install` within the console to install the dependencies required. Once that is done, you can run `node server.js` to start the server. This app doesn't come with pre-seeded data, so you can begin by sending post requests to `http://localhost:3001/api/users`. I reccomend using either Postman or Insomnia to test all of the api routes.

## Usage
